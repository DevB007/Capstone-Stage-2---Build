# Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project - IMalive
IMalive lets the people you care about know you're not dead.

You can schedule specific messages to specific people on specific days at specific times. When the time comes, IMalive will send you a notification asking if you are indeed IMalive. When you confirm your aliveness, the app will send your message to the recipient.

The intended user for IMalive is anyone who wants to let people who worry about them know they are okay. For example, students who just left for college who have moms that message them every day and ask if they are okay.

# Information

When you first open the app, you are greeted with an empty state. Press the 'plus' FAB to create a new IMalive reminder. This will open your phone's address book and allow you to select a contact.
After you have selected a contact, select the days you want to be reminded (all days selected by default) as well as a time. Lastly, enter a message you want to send once your reminder notifies you (don't worry, you can always change the message before you send it).

Now we wait... Once the specified time occurs, you will receive a notification asking if you are IMalive. Once you tap the notification, you will be brought to a screen where you can review your message before it is sent. You can edit your preset message, or even attach your current location or weather.

If you don't want to wait until the time you specified, you can tap and hold on a reminder in the list to jump to the message screen where you can then promptly send the message. Single tapping a reminder allows you to edit it.
